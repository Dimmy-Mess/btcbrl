# BTC - BRL Bot

A simple Python bot created to twet about the value of a Brazilian Real unit in Bitcoin cryptocurrency every time interval. This work was done using [Tweepy library](https://www.tweepy.org/) to handle with Twitter API and a Brazilian portuguese API called [API de Moedas](https://docs.awesomeapi.com.br/api-de-moedas). 

The file `msg.py` has all functions to produce the Tweet string, and I put all Twitter interactions in the `bot.py`. Note that I have some environment variables - these are the confidential keys gave to my Twitter Developer Account, and you will need one to run this bot!

This is my first attempt to produce a bot in all steps, from coding to deploy. I'm planning more funcionalities in the future... **Feel free to suggest changes / collaborate!** =D
